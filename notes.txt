Exercise 3 27.10.2016

Questions:
Which geometry class? How would it be implemented?
	wrapper for model that recieves a model_object in the constructor

Are these buffer types for every program?

//Assignment 3
Diffuse color should be uploaded using a uniform

Normalize everything!

Idea for switching to cel-shading
sth like: set_shader(int flag)
{
	case 1:
	glUseProgram(...)

	case 2:
	glUseProgram(...)

	...
}
}



stars:
glDrawArray instead of glDrawElements
